AutoPark: Design and Implementation of Automatic Parking System

AutoPark is a project aimed at automating the process of managing vehicle entry and exit in parking lots or toll gates. Utilizing an Arduino microcontroller, along with sensors and actuators, this system detects vehicles approaching the gate, allows access upon validation, and manages the gate's opening and closing mechanisms.
Key Materials:
    1.ESP32 or Arduino Microcontroller: The brain of the system, is responsible for processing sensor data, executing control algorithms, and communicating with peripheral devices.
    2. Ultrasonic sensors or proximity sensors are employed to accurately detect obstacles and measure distances within the parking environment.
    3. Toy Car: Serving as a real automobile for our project.
    4. Servo Motor: Used to control the steering mechanism of the vehicle during the parking process.
    5. Jumper Wires and a Breadboard: Used for circuit connections and prototyping.
    6. LCD and an I2C Module: Provide a visual interface for displaying information and status updates.
    7. LED (Light-Emitting Diode): used to indicate the availability of vacant parking slots.
